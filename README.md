<h5>sequels rule </h5>
<i>
The fact that SQL was a acroynm recursively<br>
applied to the successor of IBM's System R language,<br>
its sequel, this fact alone shows what a gift from<br>
  most high SQL is. I've decided its my jam now.

<h5>Half way there- </h5>
<i>
bout half way through google analytics now<br>
  eyeing IBM data science next.<br>
  making some headway with javascript<br>
  webdev is lagging, its the key to world domination too<br>
  gotta flesh it out, design philosophy too<br>
  simple enough, pretty much just linking to substack<br>

<h5>Uncle Kendal- </h5>
<i>
keeping up with posts daily is tough, seems...baostful<br>
  fINALLY ran a helloworld.cpp<br>
  could never figure out the compiling with VScode<br>
  switched IDEs and bam, I'm a c++ man now

<h5>IT'S BEEN- </h5>
<i>
one week into googles stat analysis course,<br>
  5 weeks worth, the pace is rudimentary<br>
  good course though, SQL is finally clicking after years of trying<br>
  used a 100x100 matrix for the image pre-circled this time, don't like it<br>

<h5>steadicam </h5>
<i>
  was reading David Bordwell's blog,pretty nostalgic<br>
  Using github as an archive is sick,<br>
  wanna start using the real capabilites though, start branching<br>
  you cann laod entire instances of vscode in github<br>
  possiblities are endless<br>
  dizzying worlds<br><br><br>

<h5>auditing </h5>
<i> started using the instaloader python library<br>
  trying to identify bot account acitivty with just metadata<br>
  <gunna audit big profiles to see how many bots their are
  inputing account data into spreadsheets to compare results,<br>
  probably gunna make some cool graphs. Flesh out the python script<br>
  to automate the process and save to a .csv<br>
  Using a new python script to "circle" the results of the random-image-generator for each post<br><br>

<i><b>MAY_16_2023</b></i><br>
<h5>first course </h5>
<i> uploaded a python script that i used to make a cool graphic for a hacker movie<br>
  gunna flesh out the repo a little later, show the variety that can be achieved<br>
  trying to keep readme posts low, seems cheap<br><br>
  started a google analytics certificate course today, should be done end of summer, yeehaw.<br><br>

<h5>wakey wakey</h5>
<i>  games, webdev, data analictics,<br>
  these are the areas I wanna focus on going forward.<br>
  In my mind, this means I need to focus on learning c++ for any serious game development work, but javascript <br>
  is a good place to start to get a handle on game logic, As I'm far more familiar with those waters than<br>
  the merky depths of C plus plus.<br>
  For web dev, the path seems clear enough: html, CSS, javascript, nodejs, express, frameworks like react and angular, <br>
  php, mongodb and django for back-end, hooking up to mySQL databases, stuff like that.<br>
  For data analytics, a large focus on python as well as SQL and Excel is an order. The tools for data analysis seem <br>
  obvious enough, its just a matter of polishing my skills with them. Maybe some R as well who knows.<br><br>
