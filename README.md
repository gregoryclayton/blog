<h5>wakey wakey</h5>
<i>  games, webdev, data analictics,<br>
  these are the areas I wanna focus on going forward.<br>
  In my mind, this means I need to focus on learning c++ for any serious game development work, but javascript <br>
  is a good place to start to get a handle on game logic, As I'm far more familiar with those waters than<br>
  the merky depths of C plus plus.<br>
  For web dev, the path seems clear enough: html, CSS, javascript, nodejs, express, frameworks like react and angular, <br>
  php, mongodb and django for back-end, hooking up to mySQL databases, stuff like that.<br>
  For data analytics, a large focus on python as well as SQL and Excel is an order. The tools for data analysis seem <br>
  obvious enough, its just a matter of polishing my skills with them. Maybe some R as well who knows.<br><br>
